## What I Learned
- Navigating through a world using A* Pathfinding
- Basic AI with states (combat, moving, ect.)
- Sending server packets to users
- Serializing & deserializing NPC data

## Note
This project was actually started and finished back in mid 2021 when I was still in High School. As a result, the code may be a bit messy, though I have improved since then.
